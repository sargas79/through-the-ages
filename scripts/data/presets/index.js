/**
 * The bundled campaign-setting calendars.
 *
 * Each entry is plain data describing a setting's calendar the way a GM would
 * fill the configuration window in by hand, plus two things the window cannot
 * express directly: a weekday anchor and a moon anchor. Those say "this date is
 * a Fireday" and "this moon is full on this night", and the preset service
 * turns them into the stored offsets. Anchors are used rather than raw offsets
 * so the canon fact stays readable next to the number it produces.
 *
 * Nothing here touches Foundry globals, so the whole set is unit testable.
